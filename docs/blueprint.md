## Core Features:

- Multilingual Chat Interface: A web-based chat interface enabling users to interact with the AI chatbot in multiple languages. This involves rendering the chat UI and handling user input and output in the selected language.
- AI-Powered Health Q&A: An AI model answers user queries about preventive healthcare, symptoms, and vaccinations using a trained knowledge base. The model will use reasoning to decide when or if to incorporate information into its output, depending on the query. The tool retrieves the response from the model, and translates the response based on the userâ€™s selected language.
